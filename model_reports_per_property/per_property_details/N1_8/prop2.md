# N1,8 — Property 2

> Single reference point verification report  
> Generated 2026-03-25

## Reference Point

- **Model:** `ACASXU_run2a_1_8_batch_2000.onnx`
- **Property:** prop2
- **Reference point (property midpoint):** `[0.639929, 0.0, 0.0, 0.475, -0.475]`
- **Network prediction:** class **0** (Clear-of-Conflict)
- **Network outputs at midpoint:** `[-0.0192, -0.0176, -0.018, -0.0166, -0.0173]`
  - Predicted class has the **lowest** output (ACAS Xu uses argmin)

## Robustness Summary

For each target class, what is the **largest ε** at which this reference point is verified (Y/UNSAT)?

### Best result per target (across all rules and α)

| Target | Class Name | Best Rule | α | Max Verified ε | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|---|----------------|--------|
| 1 | Weak Left | `Impl L2→L3 (α=0.9)` | 0.9 | 0.05 | ✅ Verified up to ε=0.05 |
| 2 | Weak Right | `Impl L2→L3 (α=0.9)` | 0.9 | 0.05 | ✅ Verified up to ε=0.05 |
| 3 | Strong Left | `Impl L2→L3 (α=0.9)` | 0.9 | 0.05 | ✅ Verified up to ε=0.05 |
| 4 | Strong Right | `Impl L2→L3 (α=0.9)` | 0.9 | 0.05 | ✅ Verified up to ε=0.05 |

**Overall:** This reference point is **fully robust** (all 4 targets verified) up to **ε = 0.05** (with appropriate NAP rules).
