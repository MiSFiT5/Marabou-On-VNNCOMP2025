# N3,1 — Property 1

> Single reference point verification report  
> Generated 2026-03-25

## Reference Point

- **Model:** `ACASXU_run2a_3_1_batch_2000.onnx`
- **Property:** prop1
- **Reference point (property midpoint):** `[0.639929, 0.0, 0.0, 0.475, -0.475]`
- **Network prediction:** class **2** (Weak Right)
- **Network outputs at midpoint:** `[0.0278, 0.0234, -0.024, 0.0226, -0.0071]`
  - Predicted class has the **lowest** output (ACAS Xu uses argmin)

## Robustness Summary

For each target class, what is the **largest ε** at which this reference point is verified (Y/UNSAT)?

### Best result per target (across all rules and α)

| Target | Class Name | Best Rule | α | Max Verified ε | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|---|----------------|--------|
| 0 | Clear-of-Conflict | `–` | – | – | ❌ Not verified at any ε |
| 1 | Weak Left | `–` | – | – | ❌ Not verified at any ε |
| 3 | Strong Left | `–` | – | – | ❌ Not verified at any ε |
| 4 | Strong Right | `–` | – | – | ❌ Not verified at any ε |

**Overall:** This reference point is **NOT fully robust** at any tested ε (at least one target cannot be verified).
