# N2,2 — Property 4

> Single reference point verification report  
> Generated 2026-03-25

## Reference Point

- **Model:** `ACASXU_run2a_2_2_batch_2000.onnx`
- **Property:** prop4
- **Reference point (property midpoint):** `[-0.301042, 0.0, 0.0, 0.409091, 0.125]`
- **Network prediction:** class **4** (Strong Right)
- **Network outputs at midpoint:** `[0.2842, 0.2857, 0.2752, 0.2536, 0.2214]`
  - Predicted class has the **lowest** output (ACAS Xu uses argmin)

## Robustness Summary

For each target class, what is the **largest ε** at which this reference point is verified (Y/UNSAT)?

### Best result per target (across all rules and α)

| Target | Class Name | Best Rule | α | Max Verified ε | Status |
|--------|------------|-----------|---|----------------|--------|
| 0 | Clear-of-Conflict | `–` | – | – | ❌ Not verified at any ε |
| 1 | Weak Left | `–` | – | – | ❌ Not verified at any ε |
| 2 | Weak Right | `–` | – | – | ❌ Not verified at any ε |
| 3 | Strong Left | `–` | – | – | ❌ Not verified at any ε |

**Overall:** This reference point is **NOT fully robust** at any tested ε (at least one target cannot be verified).
