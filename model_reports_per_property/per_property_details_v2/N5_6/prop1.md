# N5,6 — Property 1

> Single reference point verification report (v2)
> Generated 2026-03-25

## Reference Point

- **Model:** `ACASXU_run2a_5_6_batch_2000.onnx`
- **Property:** prop1
- **Reference point (property midpoint):** `[0.639929, 0.0, 0.0, 0.475, -0.475]`
- **Network prediction:** class **2** (Weak Right)
- **Network outputs at midpoint:** `[0.0274, 0.0198, -0.0198, 0.0221, -0.0161]`
- **Query filter used in this report:** `class_id = midpoint prediction`, `center_source = property_midpoint[0]`, `sample_idx = 0`

## Dedup Rule

- Repeated logical experiments are merged after the midpoint filter.
- Duplicate key: same `target`, same `ε`, same experiment label, same `α`.
- Keep order: `A (full_rule)` < `B/L0→L1` < `B/L1→L2` < `B/L2→L3` < `B/L3→L4` < `B/L4→L5` < `C (impl_ablation)`.
- The report shows only the kept rows after this overwrite rule.

## Target Summary

| Target | Class Name | Max Verified ε | Winning kept experiments |
|--------|------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| 0 | Clear-of-Conflict | – | – |
| 1 | Weak Left | – | – |
| 3 | Strong Left | – | – |
| 4 | Strong Right | – | – |

**Overall:** after deduplication, this reference point is not fully verified at any tested ε.
